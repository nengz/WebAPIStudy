The API returns up to 10 comparable properties including rent, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and location data - with new features and expanded data being added all the time! You can specify just the address but the more data you provide the more accurate your rent estimate will be. This API works by querying a massive database of recent rental listings and using a correlation algorithm to find the most comparable rentals.",

            "Description": "Route Optimization API - Patherizer (a solution to vehicle routing problem) is a cross browsers REST API supporting now a maximum of 100 stops per route or request including the start destination and the end destination. Beeing a multi stop route optimization software, Patherizer may be used by multiple calls to calculate and optimize routes for multiple vehicles, each vehicle with its optimized route. The route optimization algorythm is based per TSP (travel salesman problem) and it always calculate the shortest route betwween current stop and the next stop until it reaches the end destination. The input addresses are geocoded, so the JSON response will include latitude and longitude of each stop. If the route optimization API cannot recognize one or more of the input addresses it will not geocode these inputs and the API request will return a JSON Error as specified in the errors table. The JSON response also includes distances between each stops along the optimized route (in miles or km) and most important, the durration (in seconds) and durration in real traffic conditions (in seconds) at the time you make the request. A total distance of the optimized route is computed and also a total time.\nAllthough this Route Optimization API is intended for software development and therefore developers, we have also here an online application that may be used to get listed the optimized route from the input text basically you input start address, end address and multi stop addresses (no matter the order) along the route separated by \";\" Basically for Route Optimization API you send an authorized POST request in JSON format to the API endpoint and you get as JSON response a representing the optimized route in segments as you need to go. You may use it for commercial purposes for paid packages.\nRoute Optimization APP or API is useful for a large number of domains like: driving route optimizer, delivery routing software, vehicle routing problem, fleet routing software etc.\nFor using our API and/or APP you must create an account (free of charge, no card required), activate it from your received email, login and then start your TRIAL package with no fees as you can see at our pricing packages. After you have tested the text to speech readear API and/or APP and if you are satisfied, you may buy a paid package. You will always see at your Admin Console page the real resources consumption in real time, your invoices, you may see/edit/delete your profile or export log consents as GDPR instructed, you may read our FAQs.",

            "Description": "The customer is provided with the following procedure in order to work with the API:\n\nThe customer creates two XML files. The first is titled \u201cdata.xml\u201d and it contains information on balances, income, and expenditure. The second is \u201ccatalog.xml\u201d. Files contains background information including: products transferred (for instance, between warehouses), purchases, sales, etc. This information can be customized.\n\nAfter these files are created, they need to be packed in \u201cdata.zip\u201d archive. The system accepts the data from the files only if they are correctly named. Double-checking the file names will provide optimum results. Samples of the upload files, along with a description, are presented in Section B.\n\nOnce the files have been properly compiled and named, the customer accesses the server at https://i.mycroft2b.com and establishes a connection. This must pass HTTP Basic Authentication, and will, as long as the correct using login and password are entered as requested.\nNext, the customer sends a PUT request to the server, using the archive created at step 1. The address for this is: https://i.mycroft2b.com/api/Instances/[KEY]/Import. In the above address, [KEY] is the actual key provided at registration. The customer\u2019s login and password are required at this point.\nYou will know that your data has been successfully loaded by a response of \u201ctrue.\u201d An unsuccessful load will return a \u201cfalse\u201d.\nAfter the response is received, the connection is broken.\n\nManual Load:\nYou can manually load the data.zip file created at step 1 into Mycroft Assistant. To do so, you need to:\na) Log in to the system at https://i.mycroft2b.com using your login and password.\nb) Open the menu at the right top and select \u201cPreferences.\u201d\nc) In the \u201cData\u201d section, click on the cloud and select the file you created at step 1 (or drag the file using the drug-and-drop approach)..",

This API takes an email address within the request and performs a 3-step email list cleaning process to determine if the email address is valid or not.\nThe first step is a very basic clean where any typos, syntax errors, and duplicates are removed. At the same time, the email address is checked for bad MX records, no-reply email addresses, catch-all mailboxes etc. All this is sent back in the response JSON packet. \nThe second step is our advanced social media lookup. In this step we check to see if the email address is valid on any social media networks. We check against the top 12 social networks. This is very effective in terms of determining if a Yahoo email address is valid or not because the traditional method of checking Yahoo email addresses using SMTP does not always work. \nThe third and final step is completing a full SMTP handshake to determine if an email address is valid. \nThe API support multi-threading. For higher volume users, the API also comes with a dedicated trunk with better throttle limits to provide a faster email validation process.",

If, however, GalaxyS has been passed in as an object, the sentiment will be POSITIVE. It will be NEGATIVE for iPhone in this particular example.\nCurrently the API supports Russian language with input texts varying from long formal news posts to informal and short tweets.\nLooking for text analytics APIs?

We are an api that scrapes emails from websites.\nWhat it does:\nScrapes a website for you - We go through the website and scrapes the main page and any sub pages for e-mails and returns those to you in json.\nParses common e-mail patterns - We parse e-mails such as tom[at]site.com or tom (at) site (dot) com. Let us handle it!\nEasy API - Just provide a website address as input and you're all set!\nExcellent Support - Let us know if you have issues. We'll be on call. We also have 24/7 monitor on our API\nAbout the endpoint:\nPlease note that subsequent calls to the same url will be fetched from the cache (flushed weekly). \nPlease do note we cannot parse sites that require a login (for now), so for some Facebook pages it is not possible at the moment to fetch the e-mail.\nFinally, please note that a scrape will be terminated after 5 minutes if data cannot be fetched at that time.\nMore Detailed Information:\nReturns a list of emails scraped by priority (ie. e-mails appear on top level pages are first). Please note that subsequent calls to the same url will be fetched from the cache (14 day flush). \nWill also parse patterns such as hello[at]site.com, hello[at]site[dot]com, hello(at)site.com, hello(at)site(dot)com, hello @ site.com, hello @ site . com. \nPlease do note we cannot parse sites that require a login (for now), so for some Facebook pages it is not possible at the moment to fetch the e-mail.\nFinally, please note that the api will fetch links for up to 2 minutes. After that time it will start analysing the pages which have been scraped. Therefore please ensure that your client has a timeout of at least 150 seconds (2 mins to fetch and the rest to parse). \nPlease note that due to the fact that the api goes out to fetch the pages, the server allows only 1 concurrent request/ip. Requests which are made while the 1 request is still processing will result in a 429 code.",

The version 2 release targeted for November will include the ability to extract FileAct payloads (batch) messages are well as additional conversion use cases to ISO 20022 formats, something that is particularly useful for those migrating from legacy formats ahead of the changes coming in 2020.

In this aspect, postponement has been widely used by many scholars (for example, Ma et al. 2002, Jiao et al. 2003, Li et al. 2007, Shao and Ji 2008, Brun and Zorzini 2009, among others). The core of postponement is to delay the customer order decoupling points (CODP) (Gu et al. 2002). However, to realise postponement there must be a flexible supply chain system, especially a flexible and efficient supply chain scheduling (SCS) system to give support (Yao and Liu 2009). SCS in MC is complicated and has its own special characters mainly reflected in two aspects. One is the random information from customer orders and the complex relations among supply chain co-operators, which can cause many complicated contradictions in scheduling and bring dynamic or stochastic characteristics to it; the other is the outstanding relations of collaborative benefits and risks in this complicated environment. Therefore, we must probe the ways to respond to these characteristics and analyse the collaborative benefits and risks in MC. In our early work, we focused on how to alleviate the dominant contradictions to solve the dynamic and stochastic problems (Yao and Liu 2009), but we did not pay great attention to the collaborative benefits and risks which are also important factors that lead to the dynamic and stochastic characteristics in SCS. Based on earlier achievements, this paper introduces the collaborative benefit and risk analysis into SCS and emphasises it not only for short-term collaboration but also for long-term collaboration. Then the paper sets up a multi-objective optimisation model and an algorithm to describe the scheduling optimisation of co-operator selection and task allocation in SCS by introducing the collaborative benefits and risks with their judgment methods",

            "Description": "Digital Elevation Model API - Terrainizer (a solution to digital terrain model) is a cross browsers REST API supporting now a maximum of 2601 3D Points per request including all the selected rectangled surface as an array of equally distanced 3D Points as you may see in the figure below. The digital elevation model or digital terrain model (mesh 3D model) is based on a selecting rectangle of a slice on Earth (it may be also on oceans, seas). As data input you need to specify the North East Corner Latitude and Longitude and the South West Corner Latitude and Longitude (as upper right corner and the lower left corner of the selecting rectangle) and also the number of dividing segments on the width of the rectangle (npwidth) and the number of dividing segments on the height of the rectangle (npheight). The number of 3D Points is calculated as (npwidth+1)*(npheight+1). As more 3D points are, as smooth is the resulted mesh 3d model.\nAllthough this digital terrain model API is intended for software development and therefore developers, we have also here an online application that may be used to get the GLTF file of the mesh 3D model alltogether with other useful data like 3D points coordinates (x, y, z), the width and the height of the selecting rectangle, dx (horizontal distance between 3D Points) and dy (vertical distance between 3D Points). Basically for digital elevation model API you send an authorized POST request in JSON format to the digital terrain model API endpoint and you get as JSON response a representing the parametrs given in the table below. You may use it for commercial purposes for paid packages.\nDigital Elevation Model APP or API is useful for a large number of domains like: constructions, designers, architecture, 3D modelling, 3D simulation software, agriculture, oceanography etc.\nFor using our digital elevation model download API and/or APP (or mesh 3D model) you must create an account (free of charge, no card required), activate it from your received email, login and then start your TRIAL package with no fees as you can see at our pricing packages. After you have tested the digital terrain model API and/or APP and if you are satisfied, you may buy a paid package. You will always see at your Admin Console page the real resources consumption in real time, your invoices, you may see/edit/delete your profile or export log consents as GDPR instructed, you may read our FAQs",

Taking an image file (or URL) as input ColorTag produces a list of text labels and hex RGB values that can be then used as tags for a certain image or item. Check out visual demo here: http://apicloud.me/apis/colortag/demo/. The API can sort tags by relevance (detecting colors of objects on the image, e.g. a dress, a car, etc.) or simply by weight in the image. First mode is perfect for e-commerce applications, allowing to automatically tag items with colors by simply providing a photo or a thumbnail and build a color tag cloud, so users are able to search items by color (e.g. red). Weight sorting mode can be useful for photos, wallpapers or other images without well-defined objects on them to analyze the palette in general. Text color labels can be assigned with different precision (just basic colors, W3C-compatible colors, precise colors, etc.).",

The RESTful API returns requests in JSON, JSONP, and XML and can provide detailed information on venue lat/lon, average ticket price, seating location, and more. SeatGeek has a community portal that keeps a record of all support conversations and is a useful tool when looking to get questions answered. \nSites can also monetize their content with SeatGeek's API by registering in SeatGeek's Partner Program. Each time a partner sends a referral to SeatGeek and they purchase a ticket, SeatGeek will pay their partner 50% of the revenue earned on that transaction. Currently users are averaging $11 per sale generated.",

More profound than Watson and more accurate than Google in the travel domain. \nWe cover more than 90% of information/facts contained within the review which is far far better than any tech available.\nTesting it on hundreds of thousands of reviews (from 10 different sources), we achieved very high accuracy (precision=90-95%, recall=70-85%).\nFor the API tech description, see our website: http://unicornnlp.com/?API\nHuman-like Analysis for Hotel Reviews (and the On-Premise version AI In-the-Box for Hotel Reviews) consists of 124 Semantic Models. Each Semantic model was specially designed, built, tested, and re-tested on hundreds of thousands of accommodation reviews from 10 different sources (Booking, TripAdvisor, Expedia, Trivago, Airbnb HostelWorld, etc.).\nWe call it Human-like Analysis because with these parameters we achieve the same quality as detected by skilled analysts (humans). It opens up a lot of new functionalities that can be easily combined with your product without any post-processing or additional training on your data.\nSee what can be done with this technology: http://unicornnlp.com/?solutions-in-travel\nOn RapidAPI, only Human-like Analysis for Hotel Reviews is available in the SaaS model. \nIf you need different domains (Hostel, Apartment, Restaurant, Airline, Tours&Guide Reviews), see our website: http://unicornnlp.com/?Products\nYou can also get the On-Premise version (AI In-the-Box) with no maintenance fee and with 0 cents/text. The On-Premise version is also mastered on your data and you get even better accuracy than on the RapidAPI.\nYou can use this technology as a standalone without any linguistic or machine learning skills, or augment your already functioning machine learning solutions.\nYou do not get a \"domain-independent\" solution that sometimes works, sometimes doesn't and it is up to you to configure it to your data. We specialize in making deep AI for specific texts which are easy to use. We hide all the complexity inside and provide ready-to-use data on the output in a well-organized JSON.\nTo order AI In-the-Box for Any Travel Reviews or test it for free on your data, contact us: http://unicornnlp.com/?Contact",

DASH leverages standard HTTP protocol and can be easily deployed on existing Internet infrastructure (web servers, CDNs, firewalls, etc). \nCommon Encryption (CENC)\nCENC is an industry standards based approach to content encryption. CENC identifies standard encryption and key mapping mechanisms that may be utilized by one or more DRM systems to allow the decryption of the same file using different DRM systems. CENC enables content providers to encrypt their content once and deliver it to numerous client devices and their assorted DRM schemes. \nEncrypted Media Extensions (EME)\nEME is a proposed W3C standard that provides a set of common APIs that can be used to interact with DRM systems and manage license key exchange. EME allows content providers to design a single application solution for all devices.\nKey benefits of Widevine's DRM solution:\nSupport for reliable content protection across multiple systems:.\nProvides ubiquitous device coverage and extends synergy across multiple content protection systems. See a list of currently supported platforms.\nComplete control and flexibility during video playback:\nFully featured HTML5 video player with adaptive streaming, QoS, and accessibility support across devices.",

With our powerful API, you can create many kinds of food and especially nutrition apps.\nSpecial diets/dietary requirements currently available include: vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, gluten free, grain free, dairy free, high protein, low sodium, low carb, Paleo, Primal, ketogenic, FODMAP, and Whole 30. We will soon be adding Weight Watcher points, too.",

            "Description": "SmartIP.io is a new IP Geolocation API and Threat Intelligence service which exposes a huge amount of accurate and reliable IP data for a very convenient price.\nWe expose both IP and ASN lookups with two simple endpoints, we don't segment data response by Tiers, as most of our competitors do, instead, we return the entire dataset in our responses even in the Free tier.\nOur pricing structure is unbeatable as well, signing up, we allow up to 250,000 requests per month for Free! More information on https://smartip.io/#pricing-section\n\nWhy should I use a GeoLocation API\n\nMost companies use IP Geolocation APIs to identify their users to enrich the user experience based on their location, currency or timezone. Another use case could be identify threats and prevent frauds in time looking for Proxy connections, TOR nodes or just filtering Crawlers traffic. SmartIP.io can detect if the an IP is a proxy, TOR or even a crawler. More information on https://smartip.io/#feature-section\n\nWhy SmartIP.io\n\nEven though the API market is full of Geolocation API already, we realised that they all offer very similar datasets, and they all tend to be really expensive very quickly, segmenting data responses by tiers and adding costs to their customers which do not cost anything to them.\nOur approach aims to solve this problem exposing single endpoints which return all information with no segmentation by Tier and with a huge Free tier which allows up to 250,000 requests a month.\nWe are the only one to expose Crypto data. Our service can identify if a specified IP is running a Bitcoin node with additional information like the port from where the node is running from. We are in the process of expanding this dataset with additional blockchains and more data.\n\nOur features\nGeolocation data: at the moment we are using MaxMind database, but we are in the process of building our own GeoDatabase.\nCurrency data\nTimezone data\nSecurity data: Our service exposes Proxy data, Crawler data and TOR data.\nCrawler data: we detect the crawler type, the crawler company\nTOR data: we detect TOR exit node identifier, the published data and the last update date.\nProxy data: we detect the proxy type like \"proxy anonimyzers\", \"proxy attackers\", etc.\nCrypto data\nWe are powered by Microsoft Azure. We are 100% backed by the best cloud solution out there with no self-hosted servers. This guarantees extremely high performances and high SLA.\nOfficial client libraries available on Github for .NetCore, PHP and Javascript.\nSimple and intuitive Dashboard to manage your API keys and monitor your API calls.\nOnce registered, we offer a huge Free Tier which allows up to 250,000 requests a month.\n",

            "Description": "IronWifi offers a powerful Application Program Interface (API) that can be used to integrate IronWifi RADIUS authentication services with user and guest management systems.\nThe API framework allows your platform to interact with the network access control platform provided by IronWifi.\nWith the IronWifi API, user management systems can dynamically update the RADIUS server to instantly create or delete users in the IronWifi database, and you can set or modify access rights.\nWhen a user attempts to access the network, IronWifi uses the updated credentials as the basis for permitting activities on the network.\nWhen a user attempts to access a WiFi network, the Access Point can send a RADIUS request to IronWifi RADIUS. IronWifi authenticates the user based on the updated credentials.\nTo receive technical assistance with your IronWifi API project, or to discuss any advanced requirements that you may have, please contact us at [email\u00a0protected], or call +1 (800) 963-6221.",
