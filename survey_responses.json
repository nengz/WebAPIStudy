            "Expectations": "i expect to find up to date and complete docs in the first place, even if i'm developing the api i like to have access to docs for when i have to code the frontend for that api - using swagger is more than enough imho as long as devs remember to include all the basics like mandatory headers, auth mechanisms and summaries for all endpoints.\n\nsomething else i find it hard to live without is unit testing. throughout my career i've been part of many projects but so far none of them have implemented unit testing and for that i've had to suffer from unnecessary added difficulty when tracking bugs. i think standardizing something as simple as unit testing will boost the overall quality of apis (in this case this refers to lack of bugs) and development experience at the same time.\n\nthen, i expect us devs to look at the products we build through the eyes of our users. what i mean is: after we finish developing a feature we should test it out and everything we do that we think is cumbersome we should make it more convenient because that's what our users would want. an example of this would be expecting the user to pass an id that is not easily retrievable to access a certain resource when we could easily identify those by some other, more representative field.\n\nreally hope this helps!"
