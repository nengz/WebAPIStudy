A Large-Scale Empirical Study of Web APIs: Usages, Issues, and Expectations

In this repository, we will release the experimental dataset of our Web API study project, including:

1) Web APIs and mashups crawled from ProgrammableWeb on Nov 12, 2019

2) Web APIs crawled from RapidAPI on Nov 12, 2019

3) Web API related SO questions retrieved for the crawled Web APIs based on the API names and WAKP (i.e., a set of predefined Web API related keywords and phrases).

4) The Web API issue types manually identified from 1,886 sampled SO questions

5) The user survey designed for investigating the important features of Web APIs, validated the identified Web API issue types, and inquiring users' expectations on Web APIs.
